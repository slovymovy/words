In 1987, one hypnotherapy client experienced an apparent 'past life' as a submariner who died with his ship in 1942; he provided detailed names and dates that could be confirmed from the records of the naval base where he was supposed to have served[…]. If we insist on a Darwinian account, these phenomena must be examples of cryptamnesia, suggestion or fraud."
