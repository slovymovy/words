While the latter accomplished all that the highest perfection of drawing can achieve, (though as yet they had hardly advanced far enough in finishing to give roundness to a limb or evenness to a back-ground,) their German antagonists carried their flowing lines over the varied surface of the muscular figures, waving in conformity to the swell or recess of the anatomical markings, or meändering through a maze of folded drapery obedient to the intricate perplexity of complicated perspective ; or swept the bold stroke round the swelling limb with mingled freedom, force, and feeling : but all their powers of execution were not sufficient to compensate the deficiency of their drawing, though they made a vast and rapid improvement in this respect from their gothic manner in the early stages of the art ; yet not having the antique to guide them, they still continued gross mannerists, ever liable to extremes, mistaking stiffness for simplicity, bombast for sublimity, and extravagance for spirit."
