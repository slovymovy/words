But this is not yet a sufficient Distinction: For, suppose the Space betwixt them, which they form, be a Fess, then it's only ingraled, and not invecked; for a Fess ingraled, must have the Points on both Sides turned twoards the Field, and the convex or gibbose Parts towards the Fess it self; and so of a Bend, Chiveron, and other proper Figures in Herauldry: And if these be invecked, then the convex Parts of the Line are towards the Field; [...] within a Bordure invecked. These two Lines, ingraled and invecked, are more hard to be distinguished, when the field is divided into two equal Parts of different Tinctures, [...] Here we know not whether the Line be ingraled or invecked, except we observe this Rule, That the Form of the Line must be applied to the Colour first named.
