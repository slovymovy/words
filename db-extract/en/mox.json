However, due to the project's 350-percent cost growth and a 32-year schedule slip, both the Department of Energy and external independent analyses have consistently concluded that the MOX approach to plutonium disposition is significantly costlier and would require a much higher annual budget than an alternate disposition method, Dilute and Dispose (D&D)."
