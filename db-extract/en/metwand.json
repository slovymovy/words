He was a skilful advocate; and to be a skilful advocate lucidity of expression was essential. He could arrest attention by a pointed expression — 'good pleading,' he said, 'is the heart-string of the common law'; by a fine phrase — 'the gladsome light of jurisprudence'; or by a striking metaphor — 'the laws of England are the golden metwand whereby all men's causes are justly and evenly measured.'"
