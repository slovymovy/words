A properly prepared gelée should be deeply flavored and only slightly gelatinous; it should barely hold together when served. / With the advent of modernist cuisine in recent years, other compounds than gelatin are being used to set gelées. These gelling agents—sodium alginate and agar, to name a couple—can be used to make both cold and hot gelées, and to create foams that can be used to coat foods in the same way as gelées, effects that were unthinkable not so many years ago."
