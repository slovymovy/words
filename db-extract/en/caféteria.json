Not only did she help to set up a managerial system for the caféteria, she designed and ordered kitchen utensils, and personally made the Sichuan-style pickled vegetables. She converted this caféteria into a good place for Congress members to get a little good food during the years of famine that followed the Great Leap Forward."
