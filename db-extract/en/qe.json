Not only will it make America’s addiction to debt seem manageable, it will help ease the transition to an AI economy, Cheap debt will allow more zombie companies, which would normally be displaced by technology, to survive. […] Some of America’s current economic problems are the result of past forays into yield-curve control. The Federal Reserve’s QE during the pandemic is still causing problems in the housing market — it artificially lowered mortgages rates, which then went up when inflation returned. Meanwhile, the Treasury is losing money on its bond portfolio, and the bond market is experiencing dislocations as the Fed reduces its large post-pandemic balance sheet. All this is the result of only a few years of trying to control the yield curve. If it becomes normal policy, expect worse distortions and more threats to Fed independence. Japan’s policies, followed for decades, created thousands of zombie companies. The danger for the US is that financial repression, pursued on a large scale, would create a zombie economy."
