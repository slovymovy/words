Naturally KMT leaders boasted of these wins. In particular, they noted that Kaohsiung had been a stronghold of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. The DPP won the mayorship of Taipei. This was a major triumph. The NP's candidate was second in the Taipei mayoral context and the NP did well in the Taipei City Council race. Taiwan's new political party thus seemed to be off to a good start in winning support at the ballot box. Finally, the cause of democracy won."
