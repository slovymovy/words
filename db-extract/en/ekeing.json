We make this remark, because, if the supporter were stopt short without an ekeing, it would be better, as it causes the side to rot, and it commonly appears fair to the eye in but one direction. The Ekeing is also the piece of carved work under the lower part of the quarter-piece, at the aft part of the quarter-gallery."
