[…] The phenomena of synæsthesia are divided into three main groups: \"photisms,\" among which are included, as by [Eugen] Bleuler and Lehmann, all the varieties of pseudo-chromesthesia; \"Schemes,\" comprising not only \"forms\" (diagrammes) associated with series of words or numbers, but \"symbols,\" or particular figures associated with single letters, numerals, colors and the like; and \"personifications,\" in which the associated factor is no mere color or form, but has become richer and more concrete."
