Hu, Myra Roper and I arrived in Peking chasing an opportunity to investigate the re-education methods imposed by the Chinese Communist regime on high-ranking military and administrative personnel from the pre-1949 era. An opportunity to pursue this interesting question arose when J.P. re-established contact with his father, a former Guomindang official, after 26 years of silence. His father, imprisoned soon after Liberation for his alleged counterrevolutionary activities, had participated in a programme of re-education and had finally been released at the 1975 amnesty."
