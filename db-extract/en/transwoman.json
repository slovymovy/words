On Thursday, while watchdogging the software for any problems, she said she was also changing her Facebook identity from Female to TransWoman.\n“All too often transgender people like myself and other gender nonconforming people are given this binary option, do you want to be male or female? What is your gender? And it’s kind of disheartening because none of those let us tell others who we really are,” she said. “This really changes that, and for the first time I get to go to the site and specify to all the people I know what my gender is.”"
