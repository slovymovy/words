At Sturgeon Lake (Bishop Clut tells us), among the Indians uninfluenced by religion, there were some supposed windigos. A sudden fear of them seized upon the other Indians, and they executed one windigo. The important point in such a case was to make the cannibal vomit up the ice which he was supposed to have in his inside."

[…] The conclusion reached is that, although aspects of the windigo belief complex may have been \"components in some individuals' psychological dysfunction\" (Preston 1980: 128), there probably never were any windigo psychotics in the sense that cannibalism or murder was committed to satisfy an obsessional craving for human flesh. It is argued, rather that windigo psychosis as an etic/behavioral form of anthropophagy is an artifact of research conducted with an emic/mental bias."
